CN-CNT TTL UART 9600,8,E,1  \
Pin-out (from top to bottom) \
1 - +5V (250mV)  \
2 - 0-5V TX  \
3 - 0-5 RX  \
4 - +12V (250mV) \
5 - GND

CN-CNT female connector PAP-05V-S - JST Female Connector Housing - PA, 2mm Pitch, 5 Way, 1 Row  \
Pre-made crimp leads 150 mm crimp-free end lead PA 2.0 can be used  \
The Panasonic CZ-TAW1 appears to use a JST B05B-XASK-1 male header.

## Protocol info packet:

To get information from a heat pump, "magic" packet should be send to CN-CNT:  \

To get decimal values you must convert from hexadecimal and do some calulation depending on value. Most of them need just -128(DEC). \
As example 43 bit value to get DHW tank water set temperature b1 (HEX) = 177(DEC) - 128 = 49 C  \
Panasonic query, answer and commands are using 8-bit Checksum (CRC-8) to verify serial data. Last bit is checksum value.
